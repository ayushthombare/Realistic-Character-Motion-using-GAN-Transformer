# Realistic-Character-Motion-using-GAN-Transformer
This repository presents a deep learning–based system for improving character animation realism using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformer architectures. The project focuses on refining raw or synthetic motion data into smooth, natural, and physically plausible character movements.
